his meeting with Jerry.</p><h3>Session</h3><p>Downtime:<br>Peya meets up with Dante to meet with Absolom<br>Triston: Meets with the Technomancer, but he isn’t there anymore<br>Mira: Learns that Solomon’s father’s name is Augustine Grunderson.<br>Lee: Doing real estate, his brother is Stan Wilder</p><p>Dante and Peya go to the office and it is abandoned. A delivery person comes and Peya signs for the package. The package has an image with a grinning cat surrounded by archaic runes written on it. Peya tries to open it but fails. Dante tries to read the runes, and they say: This represents the physical world when in contact with the spiritual world. When they are together true power will be obtained. As Dante casts a spell to open it, the box begins to spin really fast, and a projection of Absolom speaks saying that he wasn’t able to talk to you about being your son. He looks at both Peya and Dante as he talks about his children. Inside the box is a wooden sphere. The edges have the archaic runes around the wooden world. When Dante reads them, it seems like they are only fragments of sentences.</p><p>A fire bomb goes off and Dante gets 2nd degree burns while Peya gets 1st degree burns.</p><p>Lee gets a call from Gale (Stan’s wife) asking if she has heard from Stan. He has been missing for a couple of days. He was taking care of some business, but he never came back. He did have a single office that he worked out of. Lee heads over, and there are police cars everywhere. Peya and Dante are in the back of an ambulance. Lee texts the group and lets Triston and Mira know about the accident.</p><p>Triston receives a text from the radio guy. He lets Triston knows that CySec is involved. Triston gets a list of four employees, we can scan their badges and get credentials into CySec.<br>Adam Ackler, Barry Berringer, Charlie Chapman, Douglas Donahue are the employees to go after.</p><p>Lee runs into the Pym Reaper and gets booked for obstructing justice. Peya tries to talk to Pym, and he says that Dante was covered in accelerant. Dante tries to convince Pym that he isn’t guilty. Pym says only Triston is missing. Triston immediately is there next to Pym. Pym calls out Detective Pierce for not getting Triston for all the crimes he committed. Mira is also pulled to Pym.</p><p>Triston tries to talk his way out of Pym’s reasoning, but Pym is convinced that the 86ers are up to no good. Pym shows a warrant for Triston because of his pistol.</p><p>Dante explains that Absolom was the one who was killed, and he was killed by Antonyn Levron. Lee shows a picture of his brother, which matches the picture of Solomon’s father, and of Absolom and of Jack Sinferno. Absolom was Peya’s mentor and turns out also his father.</p><p>Triston fades out a bit and sees a vision of a woman and a son. She glares a bit and then smiles lovingly. Triston overcomes his hate. Triston is Absolom’s father.</p><h2>Admin</h2><p>Next session is the 2nd of May.<br>As we approach the end of the season, think about final monologue (1 or 2 sentences to sum up things from your characters from previous sessions)<br>Triston has the monologue</p><h2>Geeking Out</h2><p>Peya: Grow as a team, trust with Dante<br>Dante: Helps with the whole crew because Dante has more family<br>Triston: The team is all related,<br>Mira: Grow as a team by finding out how everyone is related<br>Lee: Crew growing together</p><p><em>End Credits</em>:</p><h2>Recap from last session</h2><h3>Sunday the 27th of March</h3><p><em>Opening Monologue</em>: Sun setting in the western desert. We see Detective Jude Pierce sitting on the edge of a fountain. He has a file in his hands with his name on it. Officer Law talks to him asking if he is still working on the case. He’ll never give up until he solves the case. Flashback to him meeting a brunette. Asking her out at a bar. Dating regularly. Getting married. Beautiful marriage. Has a baby. Goes back to Rock Bottom, before the Excision. The brunette and the baby are there, he approaches them. The baby is six months old. He hears gunshots, he reaches for his gun, and the brunette panics, grabs the baby but she trips. A large flash of green light happens. The baby isn’t moving. Cut to doctor saying the baby didn’t make it. Flash to her drinking a lot. Detective Pierce says we’ll get through this. She refuses to accept it. She is slowly deteriorating. She is driving and slams into someone. He arrives on the scene and sees that it was his car with the brunette in it.</p><h3>Session</h3><p>Mira is going home and an older lady approaches her. Why didn’t you take our name. She is the mother-in-law of Solomon. She gets offended because Mira has no clue who she is. The lady slaps her.</p><p>Downtime:<br>Peya: Goes to look into the last location of Alt-F4-Life with Dante<br>Dante: Goes to look into the last location of Alt-F4-Life with Peya<br>Triston: Explores who he was before being a hobo. He finds records of a man who died four years ago in an accident at Rock Bottom<br>Mira: Spends time looking at Solomon’s shrine trying to remember the mother-in-law<br>Lee: Spends some time trying to figure out why his powers change based on which djinn he brings. They are awakening a power from within himself</p><p>Looking into Alt-F4-Life in the trades and the door is open of the abandoned office that matches the address. They see an envelope hanging by a string. Peya opens the envelope. It says, sorry I lied to you, thank you for bringing him. I need to meet with you. Bring him. As they leave the office, the lights all turn out and the door locks behind them. Peya doesn’t share this information with Dante.</p><p>Cut to the van. Triston is trying to get some sleep. A notification comes on his phone asking him if he trusts the sender yet. It is the radio guy. Triston doesn’t trust them yet. Triston didn’t keep up his bargain at the golf course.</p><p>Peya at the Rook and Pawn, closing the shop up. Peya turns to Dante, and right then the door dings as an 8 foot tall minotaur comes in asking if they sell shoes. He then asks how much the 100&quot; tv costs, and he has huge muscles. He is wearing a white shirt, slacks and jacket with a chain. It costs $800. He has $200 dollars. Dante talks to him trying to get some information out of him. The bell dings again and Alicia and Bianca come in asking about the seedy underworld. The minotaur starts leaving. Peya gives Alicia and Bianca some information on where to meet up with “The Cleaner”.</p><p>Cut to Lee looking into Antonyn’s location from his connections. Where would somebody go to hide away. It seems like he has been going into the Cysec Industries. He goes to the Upper Grinds and sees a man sweating profusely. He is very out of it. As Lee tries to heal him, his eyes glaze over and he stops breathing. He hears someone say that you killed him. It appears that the trashcan said those words. Inside the trashcan is the djinn Fever. Fever buys his explanation that he didn’t kill the man. Fever says that his magic is called psynergy. The man died from overdosing from zest. Lee lets Mira know that the cops in the Upper Grinds know that a lot of deaths from zest are heat stroke.</p><h3>Thursday the 31st of March</h3><p>Dante invites the 86ers to go to the asylum as we go to Seventh Heaven for breakfast. We hear some conversations about zest having catastrophic deaths.</p><p>At the security area Dante is stopped and is asked who he is supposed to see. Dante asks the voice in his head, “I’ve gone by many names, but they call me Mellionus” Peya attempts to get some information but it didn’t work. The security names are Hank and Fred. A man in scrubs leaves the asylum and Mira chases after him.</p><p>Mira slips into Nick’s car. Mira asks him why he is giving out zest. His boss told him too. Mira then threatens Nick to not distribute the drugs and he needs to go home and rethink his life.</p><p>The rest of the 86ers are weirded out by Mira leaving his Subaru and the driver is just crying.</p><p>As Triston pulls out his gun, Peya recognizes that Triston now has a gun. We head back to the Rook and Pawn so Peya can check her registry. There is no Triston in the registry. Peya remembers that she talked to Triston about a gun, but Peya didn’t actually sell the gun. Triston brings up the fact that he googled himself. And he found out that a Triston died four years ago. The report does say that Triston left behind a wife and a son.</p><p>As we talk about checking out Cysec, Dante gets a phone call from Sharon. She talks about 100 other people who have died over that last two days who died from zest. Alexios had a burner phone where he was texting Nick. We get Nick’s phone number. Dante tries to call Nick, and Nick doesn’t deal it anymore because of Mira. Triston runs outside and sees the minotaur (his name is Schmerple).</p><p>Triston reaches into the mist to learn through the relic. The rest of the 86ers go to Detective Pierce and Lee convinces him to see who Nick’s boss was. He was hired by a doctor Ada Kalli.</p><p>We arrive at the Asylum and schedule an appointment for tomorrow.</p><p>Downtime<br>Peya: Works the case to learn about Ada<br>Dante: Works the case to learn about Ada via the voices in his head<br>Triston: Texts the number and he needs to talk to the Technomancer and goes to talk to Jeff<br>Mira: Rests so she isn’t as drained<br>Lee: Works with the Black Family to reduce his legal team</p><p>Dante asks Mellionus does know Ada. She prescribes medicine, and has worked there for 10 years. She is in charge of Zest. Peya works her underground network about Ada. She has a clean record. No connection to Cysec is known. She has had contact with many of the dealers in the underground.</p><h3>Friday the 1st of April</h3><p>We go to Ada Kalli. She says we look stressed. Where are you getting the zest. Both Dante and Triston are feeling an attraction to opposite places somewhere inside the asylum. Dante lets Ada know about the voice in his head. Dante goes to head towards Mellionus. Triston is feeling a pull towards the ‘B’ wing.</p><p>Mellionus wants her to do it. She is bound to him. Of all the crazies in this city he is the most dangerous. She tells us to relax since it is part of Mellionus’ plan. They didn’t need the money, they needed the dreams. Zest has been stopped.</p><p>Triston walks down the hallway. He hears “fancy seeing you here”. In a cell is Cyrus sitting in a cell with his missing arm bandaged up. Cyrus is infiltrating the asylum. Cyrus is Triston’s brother. “You’ve started using your gun again.”. Triston checks to see if his gun is still there. “Gatekeepers must’ve done a number on you.” What is this gun? It’s always been yours. Why don’t I remember it? You didn’t want to remember it, it caused too much pain. How do you know this? I’m your brother. What happened to me four years ago? You set off an excision and it made you crack. But I see that same blood-thirstyness has come back to you hasn’t it. Then orderlies take Triston back to the entrance.</p><p>Dante goes down the hallway and it is getting darker and darker. The door has a lot of bolts and locks on it, but it is propped open. He sees a man in a straight jacket rocking back and forth. Dante closes the door behind him. What do they call you. They know me as Jerry Duponte. Weren’t you the one who brought me here? I’m the living embodiment of the shadows and of nightmares. “Do you want to take over this place with me?” “I think you’ll change your mind over time. How do you like your arm that I gave you.” What do you have going on here? Just feeding a bit of an army. “Can you do me a favor? Can you scratch my back?” Justification about Alexios’ death by zest was because of Alexios’ desires. “You need to tell Cyrus Rolland to get out of my asylum before I make him.” Dante leaves and heads towards Cyrus. The orderlies come and take him back to the security entrance.</p><p>Everyone works their way to the entrance.</p><p>Cut to police standing over a dead body. Detective Pierce turns the body over and see’s that it is Jessica, his ex-wife.</p><p><em>End Credits</em> Cut to scarred man (Razz) inside the office. Absolom is there and the scarred man comes in. We had a deal, what happened last time that you told someone you were their father. You killed Solomon. I’m not going to kill Dante and Peya, I’m going to kill you. Pull away and we hear a scream.</p><p>Cut to Detective Pierce. We finally got a lead on the explosion that happened four years ago. There is a hidden room that is blast resistant. There is the body of Solomon shot half dead.</p></article><a href="/recaps">Back to session recaps</a></div></body></html>
