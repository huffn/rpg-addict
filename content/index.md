I'm thinking about stories pretty much all the time.

Lately I’ve been wrapped up in a few TTRPGs, and this is where I dump the thoughts that won’t leave my head — session moments, character stuff, weird ideas, whatever sticks.

I’ll also share some of my notes on worldbuilding and storytelling. I’m always trying to figure out how to make worlds feel alive and how to tell better stories, whether I’m running a game or just playing in one.
