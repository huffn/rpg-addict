## Story
Some time has passed. We’ve made it to Feathershawl’s home the Hollow wood. His given name is Ty-luen, but everyone calls him Feathershawl since he wears a feather shawl. The elder of Hollow wood is named Gwennen. Hollow wood is a merchant town. It is open to outsiders. We start looking into the petrified people from Innean. Hollow wood is close to the silver glade.

Nausics and Siftress and mage from Hollow wood named Arden are working to get a cure for the petrification. Arden is certain that a very rare flower that blooms up the mountain that would be a vital part of the petrification potion.

Vuxen and Ty-luen will take hold of the Primal Well.

It is dusk and we are running away from some hill wolves as we are trying to climb up the mountain to get the twilight Lilly before the sun comes up and it withers to ash. Arden sent along with us his understudy named Jassen.

Telemachus picks up a rock and hurls it and it clips one of the hill wolves in the snout as the rock explodes against the ground. Two of the wolves have been taken out by it.

Rhiana blasts the other hill wolf with Fulminus and the wolves leave us for easier prey.

We make it to the base of the mountain but it is pitch dark. Telemachus hurts himself but is able to make two torches to help light the way for the party.

We make it to the top of the mountain and find the twilight lily that only blooms on a full moon. Jassen carefully plucks the flower and we start heading back down the mountain.

Telemachus asks Rhiana about her travels. She shares information about her pet bird named Topaz. She’s met many unsavory characters. Telemachus asks about the food she’s had. And if it is as crazy as the mushrooms that the moon shadow  elves have given us.

Tressal talks about how we’re all stronger together. Jassen feels the same way about building off of each others strengths.

As we continue working our way down the mountain we encounter some giant worms that exited their cave when they heard us talking. Tressal casts dark magic on the worms and all of them got blasted.

We work our way down the mountain as the sun is getting close to cresting the mountain top. We near Hollow Wood. We hear a loud roar as the episode finishes.

All we need to do is get the flower back to Arden and he’ll take care of it. Spelled Ardyn.
