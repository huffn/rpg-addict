## Story
We step into the room with the bookshelf, the floor drops out from under us. We fall into a dark room and the trap door closes itself. There is a small table with a lantern on it. We light it and use it to see some marking on the wall. After pressing them in sequence the door appears with a stair leading back to the library.

In the library there are a bunch of books. We hear a ringing sound. When the drawer is opened, there are eight seashells and the ringing sound grows louder.

We decipher the books and the riddle talks about the tides.

The next room has a small pedestal and there is a mural surrounding the wall. There are six indentations on the pedestal. Placing the puzzle in the pedestal made six panels open up and we placed the newly revealed glass into the pedestal and light got reflected onto the floor.

The stain glass mural slides open revealing a ladder going up and down and a door going forward. Up the ladder is the lighthouse, and we turn the lighthouse to illuminate a nearby inn. The door forward leads to a portal into the inn. We talk to innkeeper Betty who is the daughter of the puzzle lighthouse owner. We go down into the basement of the inn and open up the treasure chest. And discover writings about how to combine the elements into new forms of magic.

Montage scene as we get back to Hollow Wood and finish the depetrificiation process and Rihana's parents meet up with Rihana.
