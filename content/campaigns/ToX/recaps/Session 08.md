## Story
We met up with Dian and then met Os Lumina. Os dismissed Plunky from her position and Tressal took Plunky on as a squire. We freed Os from her captivity here in the grove. Os grows from the infusion of power from the primal well. Os roars and sends out a shockwave and our vision goes dark. We see a vision of a bright light on a tower and we are surrounded by creatures who appear agitated. We see some mantigrades being irritated.

As we wake from the vision we see floggula. Os Lumina yells to us to fight! We beat up Floggula and from the smoke created from Tressals spell we emerge victorious to the villagers of Hollow Wood. Os looks to the north and senses an imbalance to the magic. There is a corruption that threatens the world.

Os apologizes she wasn't trapped here by imprisonment, she was not the grand daughter of Lunare Tenebris. She was just a phase dragon. Now with the primal well she can leave as an eclipse dragon. Plunaka Le'leki joins Tressal as a sentinel. Now she has been named Naka.

Telemachus drags Dian back to the Inn so that Dian can get taken care of Paula at the Inn. Dian took quite the beating during the fight. Knocked over by the tail, and then bashed on the head by Os' wings when she was taking off.

Riana remembers that there was a tower in Luxaria. Telemachus is directed to Eltha (a sun elf) at the artisian shop with Arden. He had probably seen that tower. Luxaria. It is most definitely the Sun Forge. Which had been corrupted by Viren the dark mage. Arden lets us know that in Luxarea there is a Fire Thorn Pear that can help with the depetrification process. Most ideal is the whole plant. Acceptable is just a leaf. Please don't let it be corrupted or destroyed by the skirmishes.

Tressal walks into the Blacksmith. The blacksmith explains that the earth has now been removed off of the primal stone. It is actually a sun primal stone.
