## Story
As we head north to the sunforge, we hear a dragon fly overhead. It is an orange and green fire dragon. As it is flying around it has those two energies phase back and forth. As it dives towards us, we get out of the way.
With the dragon flying overhead we decide to scout out our path that we should be taking. Dian maps out a better map than what Tressal was able to do with dark magic.

Riona finds a purple mechanical bird. It was a sentry for an elf named Eckers. He wants to use the purple potion to help the dragon, but Vikin says we need to save the potion for the Sunforge.
