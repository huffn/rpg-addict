## Story
Telemachus dreams of a deep forest maze. He is looking for something, and spots a man in a robe and then wakes up. As we investigate the letter, we spot a dementor looking sigil.

Tressal and Dian head over to the blacksmith to get the curse removed from his quill. Removing the curse broke the quill's main function. The artisian suggests that with a root-weed, everdell flower, emerald gemstone, and a silverfrost leaf, he could get it working again. We also still need a billowing bluebell as the remaining ingredient in the depetrification potion.

We head out to meet with the stranger from the note. We get there and after some searching find a rock with the dementor symbol on it. When pressed, a path starts to glow and we follow it. We meet the hooded stranger who's name is Vax. He tells us that to find out more about the lighthouses, we need to pass four tests. The first test is on the peninsula along the coast near Katolis.

While traveling, Pepper brings up the Ruins of Elarian. Tressal shares what he has learned about Elarian, and Pepper shares what elves believe.
