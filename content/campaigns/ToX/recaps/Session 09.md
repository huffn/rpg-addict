## Story
Diyan has a dream about when he and Telemachus participated in a tournament where Diyan ended up taking second place.

Javin was a sunfire elf that Eltha crossed across the desert with. He is the bartender. He suggests we find Nessle the Earth Blood Elf.

We see some antlers. They belong to Nessle. Nessle thinks he has seen Rhiona before. It turns out it was probably her parents.

We caught up to the ambler. Telemachus bargins his cooking skills to get a ride to Lux Area. The owner of the ambler is a earth blood elf named Pepper. Ambler's name is Sparky.
