## Story
We make our way past the nursery rhyme mural.
Inside is a half circle room with statues of an adventuring party. After returning their lost weapons the door unlocks.
There is a stairway up blocked by two guard statues, Dian pushes the spears up and we climb upstairs.
We solve a bunch of puzzles. We get a key, and a door opens up.
The next room is pitch dark. We enter the room, and follow the pattern of the lanterns to the exit.
In the next room there are a bunch of candles and we blow them out.
The next room has a bookshelf and that is where we stopped.
