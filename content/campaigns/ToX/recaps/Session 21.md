## Story
As the darkness disperses with the departure of the shadow-eater. Tressal has a vision of the previous owners of the lighthouse. Tressal draws the lady from the vision and Telemachus recognizes her as Lucy. As we explore the lighthouse, none of the switches seem to be doing anything.

Dian checks the tombstone. The name reads Stephen P Lichenbacher. The tombstone says:
Once living now I'm empty, 
Though it's not so bad it seems
For I can hold a thousand worlds
and even all your dreams.

Tressal presents an empty page from the dead dark mage's journal. Magic happens, and then a compartment in the tombstone opens up. Tressal finds a piece of a star from a necklace, it is dull contained in a glass marble. It is emanating a small amount of star energy

Inside the lighthouse, Telemachus finds everything that was preventing the light from working. It still needs to be fixed. We fix it up and the gemstone is drained.

We head back to Lucy's house, and we can't find anything of hers there. Just our stuff. She did leave a note: "Thank you for freeing my sweetheart, I'm forever in your debt. ~Lucy"

At her house, Vax pops in and says thanks for clearing out the shadow-eater. The next challenge is a hard one to get in, the previous lighthouse keeper was obsessed with puzzles and riddles. He rigged the entire place with puzzles and traps. We're being tasked to do an escape room lighthouse. But first we need you to get a new gem from a sunfire mage.

He gives us a ride to Hollow Wood. We jump on Sparky and head over to Lux Area.

While in Hollow Wood Diyan rolls terribly for his quill, but does get his quill back up and running. While that is happening we drop off all the ingredients for the depetrification process.

Errol mentions a mage named Merril who could reimbue the gem.

We startle Merril and ask him to refill the gemstone. He said he can fix it if we leave him alone for half an hour.

We get the gemstone from Merril. And one travel montage later we place the gemstone back in the lighthouse. It seems to look like it'll last longer than Merril had initially suggested.

We travel to the puzzle lighthouse. It looks precarious. Having an unusual shape. There is magic emanating from it. Tressal gets a vibration from his unicorn cellphone seeing that there are lots of doors and cogs and lots of puzzles. One room towards the top has something important there. After the vision, we look for a door, and we don't see one.
