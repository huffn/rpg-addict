## Story
Opening: Queen got sick and her daughter found a tome that taught about how to harness the power of the sun. There are rumors of these healing herbs being stored in arboretums in Sunfire Elves. This was the tale that Pepper told us.
Pepper shares a story about a man who disappeared from his lighthouse and everyone thought he died, but then randomly a tombstone popped up with his name on it.

We get to the oasis and Telemachus makes dinner. Tressal, Dian and Riona fight and collect some soulfang serpents.
A creature steals the compass from Riona and when she gets the compass back, she has a vision of her parents in a cave where a bright flash of light happens.

We all get some sleep and in the morning Pepper starts getting ready to get a move on.
As we travel, Sparky's foot gets stuck in the sand and Telemachus helps her foot get free, but does get a little injured.
Pepper is sad, and Telemachus gives her some pepper to use as a seasoning on her food to try and cheer her up.

We make it to the outskirts and set up camp. We sleep and in the morning say goodbye to Pepper. We're supposed to talk to Vackeay.

We get stopped by Vackeay, who doesn't trust Tressal at all. Telemachus takes the canteen of magenta potion and promises to put it into the sun forge to try and reduce the corrupted explosion that is coming.
