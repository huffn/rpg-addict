## Story
Ren leaves Tressal because he only loves her for the social standing.

Orta belches a little fire, and Diann puts the fire out. Eckers takes the second potion to help the evacuation. Ren sets her book down, says she did what she wanted to do, and she heads off. Telemachus grabs her book before she dashes off. We work our way towards the inner city. We look for things that can help put the potion in the sun forge. Telemachus finds a chimney cleaner. Tressal finds a red painted stick.

We make our way into the inner city. Lots of the buildings are all boarded up. We physically can feel the corruption. We come across another refugee camp and Vikin heads over to try and get them to leave the city. She tempts us to give up some of the potion, but we don't relent. As we work our way through the inner city Vikin points out the Fire Thorn Pear plants. They are clearly corrupted right now. We make it to the edge of the inner city and we see a big field between us and the Sunforge tower. Halfway through the field, we hear Orta working her way towards the Sunforge. We all take some corruption as we get closer. Vikin collapses and we tell her to head back and help the refugees. She gets our names on a piece of paper so that they can be spelled correctly.

Inside the tower we're getting some really weird vibes. Challenge time. Ascend the tower to the Sunforge. After some mishaps (mostly Tressal) we make it to the top of the tower. Telemachus gets thrown towards the Sunforge and he lets go of his staff as he falls to the ground. It flashes yellow and then starts pulsing faster and faster.

We all work our way to the outskirts of the city.
