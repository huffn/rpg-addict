## Story
Telemachus brought Rhionas parents over to her. We look around and find other artifacts, namely one that can heal, but it has the same petrification problems. Tressal found a healing book that's pages were bright linen. The healing artifact is composed of impossible angles much like an escher staircase. Dian found a whisperwing quill. Dian found a box to put the whisperwing quill in so he didn't get petrified. Telemachus uses his staff and padded cloak to get the healing artifact on the top of his staff. He won't touch it since it still could petrify somebody.
On the surface, the door closes and we hear a screech and fire blasts down nearby. Chlors runs out to the woman who we think is Mensa. Ekers runs around the corner with his sword drawn. Tressal urges one of his super soldiers to throw Ekers who will be carrying the second potion into the dragon. Dian makes a fool of himself distracting the dragon, Tressal chokes the dragon into submission. And Ekers is able to administer the potion to the dragon (Orta). Our d10 potion is now a d8 potion.

We come to a three way standoff. Vikin says we need Chlors to get to the Sunforge. Ekers says we should take Orta the dragon to the Sunforge. Mensa says we need to leave Chlors with her since they need to help evacuate the town.

While we decide, we help put out the fire of Mensa's shop.
