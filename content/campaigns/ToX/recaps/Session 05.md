## Story
After the fight, Tressal works on reducing his corrupted stress. The next morning, the group visits a drink shop where they try a new drink called "hot brown morning potion." Telemachus is exhausted from a poor night’s sleep due to the death of Tardi. The party overhears a conversation about a dark mage who died fighting wolves near Hollow Wood. Tressal asks for directions to the location, and they are given a map.

Tylluan enters the cafe and tells the party that Os Lumina will meet with them in the evening, which they agree to. The party travels to the hill where the dark mage died, confirming that he was killed by wolves. Tressal examines the mage’s belongings, finding a large stone, a journal, and a malfunctioning compass. The compass reacts differently depending on who holds it.

Rhiana senses the stone has a primal energy, and Tressal identifies it as an Earth primal source. Tressal also discovers an Earth magic primer hidden in the mage’s pocket. As the group heads back to town, Tressal visits the Blacksmith to inquire about cleaning the primal stone.
