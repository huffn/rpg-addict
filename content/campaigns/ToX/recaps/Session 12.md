## Story
We see Chlors run up to some guards. They say that it's owner is named Mensa. Chlors is following us until we run into Mensa. We look at the paper that was dropped by the elf from last session. It has a picture of a distinct crack on it. Vikin recognizes the crack and takes us to a location on the city wall. When we get their we run into Frieren again and she claims she has been trying to open up a door here, but it has been sealed. When we bring the potion to the door, it reacts to its proximity and opens up. Frieren rushes in and heads down the stairs into the darkness.
We follow and as we descend down the stairs we feel the corrupting power of the Sun Forge less and less. At the bottom of the stairs we see a medicinal garden as well as a treasure chest with some legs sticking out of it wiggling. We open the chest up and Frieren thanks us before running off looking for treasure.
We work with Vikin and find everything we need to make another potion. Afterwards as we look around the cavern we come across Frieren at a bookcase. We find a book about lighthouses, and a book called the Tome of the Lost. It describes an artifact that looks like some dowsing rods that can locate any missing person. It does warn that much like the Primal Well, it is dangerous to touch unshielded. We locate this artifact and see that Rhionas parents are petrified when they touched the artifact. We also learned that Frieren's name is Ren.
