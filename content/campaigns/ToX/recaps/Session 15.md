## Story
We run out of the inner city and the blast passes us and the two super soldiers deflate back to regular human sizes. We receive thanks from a lot of the elite of city. One of the officials is named Lamis and the other is named Errol.

Dian recognizes that one of the "super" soldiers as Chad Salmond, the guy who beat out Dian from the challenge of the clans. Eckers pledges his life to helping rebuild the Sunfire elves home.

An official Lamis comes up and thanks us for our sacrifice in helping reduce the blast. Tressal offers up his primal stone but they say it isn't needed at this time.

We get a withered fire thorn pear.

We run into Pepper and her ambler Sparky. We compare our notes and narrow down what the potential lighthouse locations might be.
