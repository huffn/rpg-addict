## Story
The blacksmith will work on the primal stone carefully (but slowly). We hear screams in the marketplace. The assassin Pandine finishes off a transformed mantigrade. She rips into Fenneth the bug merchant and tells him to leave. She had no idea the bugs could be so dangerous. They are spreading the word now to make sure anyone who has purchased any of the mantigrades doesn't trigger their transformation. She hasn't made any progress with the worms. Pandine hasn't spoken to Os Lumina before but she imagines she would be a sight to behold.

Tylluen comes up to us and tells us to grab the primal well and meet with Os Lumina. Tressal wears the breastplate that protects him from the primal well.

As we approach the glade, we see a lot of withered plants. There are arm length worms churning the ground before disapearing. There are 30 foot slabs of granite blocking our path. Plunky (a red panda like creature) insists on guarding the glade zapping anyone who trespasses.

Tressal acts as our lookout, but doesn't see anything. As we cross through the first ring of stones, we hear in our minds a booming voice that says that we need to halt. We halt and out from a crack in a nearby rock high overhead we see the cutest most cuddliest thing ever. This is the sacred glade of gloaming.
