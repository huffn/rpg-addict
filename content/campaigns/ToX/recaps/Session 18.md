## Story
We get beat up by some jeweled armadillos, but Diann gets an emerald.

Pepper asks us about Vax the lighthouse guy, and we think we can trust them.

We make it to Elarian. And we find writings about the Star Elves, Diann finds the silverfrost tree. Tressal finds the skeleton of a unicorn and everyone gathers to see, and Tressal asks Riona to touch the skull since there was a repulsion field.
