## Story
Hestia discovers a hidden stairway behind a bookcase, leading to a room filled with mummified Skywing elves frozen in horror, seemingly trapped by sky or earth magic. Disturbed, she investigates further. Meanwhile, Routhna successfully leads the townspeople, with Nekrex’s help, to build gliders for their escape. Light magic users, Noko and Siftress, strengthen the gliders' joints, while Routhna takes care of giant centipedes that appear after the island collides with the mountainside.

Tressal learns from Nausics that, as the keeper of the Primal Well, Nausics is forbidden from touching it or he would turn to dust. Nausics has been working with Vuxen, a blacksmith, to create a chest plate that can safely handle the Primal Well. When the island shakes from impact, the group hurries into action.

Nausics and Tressal head to secure the Primal Well, while Hestia learns that the petrified townspeople were test subjects for the chest plate. As wolves approach, Tressal uses dark magic to put them to sleep, allowing Routhna, Hestia, and Nekrex to transport the petrified bodies. They all converge at the Primal Well, where Feathershawl, caught in a trap, tries to take it but is slowed by Nausics’ wind magic. Tressal secures the Primal Well, preventing Feathershawl from touching it and getting petrified.

The group successfully evacuates the petrified bodies by dragging them down the mountain. In the end, they realize that Nausics and Feathershawl could balance each other out in leadership, but note the challenge of Feathershawl having been outcast. They resolve that if the communities don't cooperate, they'll take the Primal Well and give it to the other group.
