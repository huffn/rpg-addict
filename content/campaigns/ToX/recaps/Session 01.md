## Story
The story centers around a floating island called Innean, which has drifted west and is now on a collision course with a mountain range. Centuries ago, Earthblood elves and Skywing elves shaped its stone foundation and installed the Primal Well, an artifact that allows the island to float. Feathershawl, a Moonshadow elf, hires a group to retrieve the Primal Well before the island crashes, as he believes it can save his people from famine.

The group, composed of Tressal, a snarky teenager and dark magic user; Routhna, a giant warrior; and Hestia, a curious scholar, embarks on a journey to Innean via a moonbeam platform. Once they reach the island, they encounter an unexpected group of residents who have lived there for centuries, unaware of the island’s imminent danger. The group tries to help the islanders, working on solutions to save the population, including using fabric parachutes or magic to escape.

Meanwhile, Feathershawl becomes distracted by the moon magic swirling around him, leading him to seek out the Primal Well. The island's keeper, Nausics, is focused on protecting the Primal Well but is eventually convinced to consider allowing the artifact to be used for the greater good of both societies. The group splits up to explore the island further, with Hestia finding a hidden stairway behind a bookshelf while Tressal negotiates with Nausics. Feathershawl, frustrated and anxious, continues his search for the Primal Well as time runs out.
