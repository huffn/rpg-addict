## Story
We all join up at Os Lumina, finally joining up with Diyan. Os Lumina gets after Plunky for leaving her post. Os Lumina thanks us for the notice that we were coming, and she was happy that we brought the Primal Well. Her mother is Luna Tenebris. She is no longer an arch dragon, she was imprisoned here before she was hatched and is stuck in the grove. This is not an existence, she deserves to be free. The worms are actually an ancient collective called Floggula. 

After much back and forth, we give Os Lumina the primal well and she says lets do this, and that is where we end.
