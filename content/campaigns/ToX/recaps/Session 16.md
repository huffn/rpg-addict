## Story
As we pour over the map to see where the lighthouses are, a bird bursts out of the forest and snatches up the map and starts to fly away. We beat the bird up and get the map back. Pepper finds a passage in the legends book and discovers that the Lighthouse might actually be in Katolis.

We travel across the desert, and on the outskirts come upon an earthblood elf named Lilly. She offers some of the food she caught. Telemachus cooks up some of the fish and offers it to the group.

We continue on towards the forest. Tressel spots Ren out of the corner of his eye, and he does his best to woo her, but he has to find her first. But he is unable to do so.

As we travel in the forest, we feel like something is following us. Tressal makes eye contact with the tiger. It steps out and sits down and sticks out it's tongue and Tressal gets a note from an anonymous sender that has all our names on it. It also says meet in the mountains tomorrow morning.

We walk towards Hollow Wood and drop off Rionas parents with the other petrified people. And drop off the fire thorn pear as well as the herbs from the Queen's Reserve.

Dian hooks back up with Paula the inn keeper.

Next session tomorrow and the mysterious sender.
Dian thinks he can meet up with Arden to uncurse the whisperwill quill.
