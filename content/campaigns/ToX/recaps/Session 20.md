## Story
We approach the lighthouse that is surrounded by fog. We give Vax the gemstone and he places it into lighthouse. He milks the working gemstone and gets the **glowing essences of the summer sun's dew** a super powerful healing potion that should be able to help with the depetrification process. Vax tells us that the next challenge is litterally the stuff of legends. Years ago a lighthouse keeper left is post. And in it's disuse many ships were lost at sea and became haunted. He then leaves via a bird.

We run into an old man named Peter telling us not to go there, because of the shadow-eater. Dian finds a 93 year old widow named Lucy whose children have all left. Her kids were named Lian, Lessal, Lelemachus, and Liona, and Lepper. In the morning we head to the lighthouse. Dian looks for the tombstone and finds everdell flowers surrounding the grave. As he picks one, a bunch of spirits surround Dian.

We head into the Lighthouse. We start fighting the shadows. After defeating the shadow monster, it lightens up a bit, but we still feel that the shadow monster is still out there somewhere, but we do chase it out of the lighthouse.
