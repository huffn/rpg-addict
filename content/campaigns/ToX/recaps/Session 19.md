## Story
The Unicorn taunts Tressal, and Tressal returns in kind, and after some back and forth, we all get teleported out of Elarian. We work our way towards the lighthouse and run into Vax. He tells us that the gemstone that powers the lighthouse has been stolen. On our way up the mountain, a pack of hill wolves attacks us (foolishly) and meet an untimely end. We continue up the mountain and enter the cave. The dragon turns out to be Aus Lunimna. Telemachus provides a beautiful (24 result) meal, but she isn't convinced. Tressal agrees to loan his primal stone so that Aus can continue her experiments. We make it to the lighthouse that Vax circled on a map for us.
