![Telemachus](telemachus.png)

## General Description
An exiled noble from Del Bar turned farmer, Telemachus prefers finding peaceful solutions to his problems since it was the fear of violence that got his family exiled in the first place.

## Appearance
Telemachus is broad shouldered, and with fifteen years of hard labor working on the mountain farm, he is quite strong from clearing out the many boulders found on the family farm.

## Personality
A gentle soul, Telemachus is slow to anger. Being larger than most of those around him, his moves are slow and precise to ensure that he doesn't hurt those around him. If you didn't know Telemachus, you might think he was slow witted, but he just doesn't share his thoughts much, content with letting others say what is on their minds.

## Background
A distant relative of the Late King Florian, Telemachus' family had been exiled from Hinterpeak fifteen years ago when King Florian ensured that his eldest son would have no competition when the time came for succession.  Telemachus spent the next fifteen years working on a small mountain farm on the border of Del Bar overlooking the Independent Isles.

## Memories
When Telemachus was little, he had been roughhousing with his cousins and one of his cousins got hurt due to his actions. That was the event that made Telemachus aware of the disparity between his strength and others, and his reluctance to cause that kind of hurt again.
