## The World of Fabula Ultima
A majestic high‑fantasy world infused with JRPG tropes, ancient magi‑tech, and a planet whose very heart is a machine. Cultures feud, magic and technology intertwine, and mysteries stretch back into forgotten ages.
## Cosmology & Core Pillars
### The Soulstream
All things—living and unliving—are connected by a circulating stream of souls.
- Some civilizations harness **soul‑energy** as a power source.
- Others fear its corruption, which can twist creatures into monsters.
### Perpetual Conflict
Kingdoms and cultures across the world have never united.  
Reasons include:
- ancient grudges
- ideological and religious disputes
- resource scarcity
- injustices that echo real-world tensions
### A Fantastical, Thematic World
Realism is secondary to _emotion and spectacle_.  
A flying fortress may border a Greek‑inspired city-state; Song‑dynasty armor might coexist with Renaissance alchemy. What matters is style and theme.
## The Terminus (The Breaking)
**Twenty years ago, the world stopped rotating.**
What was once a predictable cycle of day and night halted entirely.
Consequences include:
- Regions locked in **eternal day** or **eternal night**
- Climate upheaval
- Crop failure or sudden abundance
- Desperate migrations
- Conspiracies, blame, religious interpretations
## Five Years Ago: The Shattered Statues
Every statue of a human figure—across all nations—**cracked or shattered** on the same day.
Paintings, tapestries, reliefs, and non-figurative sculptures remained intact.
No one knows why.
## Nations, Lands, and Regions
### The Radiant Seat _(Holy City-State)_
A powerful theocracy, politically influential and culturally dominant.
- Likely sits in **perpetual daylight** after the Terminus
- Center of pilgrimage, doctrine, polemics, and disputes
- Views itself as moral authority for the world
### Samitra _(Desert Kingdom)_
An expansive desert empire.
- Harsh climate; resource scarcity defines life
- Proud martial tradition
- Tense relations with the Radiant Seat
- Rumored ancient ruins buried beneath shifting sands
### Voland Etherium _(Mountain Sky Realm)_
A breathtaking mountainous region whose peaks breach the upper atmosphere.
- Skies appear **dark blue or black** at high altitudes
- Cities cling to impossible cliffs
- **Airships** serve as main transport
- Ruled by an emperor whose agenda remains opaque
- Produces rare **etherial fuels/resources**
### Dhruv _(Forest / Thicket Region)_
A dense, vast woodland (some of it petrified or mythically immense).
- Culture inspired by Indian aesthetics and myth
- Now in **perpetual darkness**
- Relations strained with **Lux Arcanium**
- A proud, spiritual people whose forests may hold ancient truths
### Galatea _(Horse Plains)_
Endless grasslands and fertile fields.
- Renowned horse‑lords
- Likely major food supplier to the Radiant Seat
- Pastoral, open, mobile culture
### Savawell Thicket _(Borderland Wilds)_
A dense, shifting, mystical woodland adjacent to the Broken.
- Acts as a **dangerous frontier** between civilization and the anomalies emanating from the Broken
- Known for soul-energy fluctuations, strange beasts, and unpredictable terrain
- A place of superstition, ruin, and half-remembered warnings
- Travelers treat it as a natural barrier or omen-laden crossing
### The Broken _(Uncharted Peninsula & Adjacent Waters)_
A jagged landmass no one successfully surveys.
- Expeditions vanish
- The seas around it behave unpredictably
- Possibly tied to **The Breaking**
### Lux Arcanium _(Independent Magic Academy)_
A prestigious magic academy situated on an island in the Astral Sea.
- Politically neutral (officially)
- Not directly funded by the Radiant Seat
- Located in **perpetual daylight**
- Believed by Dhruv to have _caused or benefited from the Terminus_
### The Shining Sea
A bright, glittering expanse of water near the Radiant Seat.
- Major trade route
- Source of myths about light‑touched creatures
## Tensions & Threats Across the World
- **Dhruv vs. Lux Arcanium:** Dhruv believes the academy had a hand in halting the planet.
- **Samitra vs. Radiant Seat:** Longstanding political and religious friction.
- **Desperate Nations:** Dark‑locked regions face starvation and may turn to conquest.
- **Ancient Technology:** The planet’s core is mechanical—but its origin and operation are lost.
- **The Broken:** A supernatural or physical hazard protecting forgotten truths.
