# Secrets, Agendas, and Deeper Truths

---
## Truth of the World’s Core

The world _is_ a sphere—but beneath the surface lies:
### The Planetary Engine
- A mega‑mechanism built by an ancient civilization
- Powered by **soul‑energy**, harvested from the soulstream
- Responsible for planetary rotation, tectonics, seasonal flow
- Now partially dormant or damaged
The engine is:
- Ancient
- Semi-sentient
- Misaligned or damaged
- Connected to multiple surface access nodes (one is near the Broken)
### Who Built It?
Not confirmed, but options include:

- Precursor humans
- An extinct soul‑bound species
- Early arcanists who merged magic & machinery
- A forgotten empire of the Broken

The party will slowly uncover this.

## The Terminus (The Breaking) — What Actually Happened

The world stopped rotating due to **a system failure in the engine’s stabilizer**, not a natural phenomenon.

Potential causes (choose which path you want):
1. **Sabotage** — Voland Etherium or Dhruv extremists
2. **Sealed Emergency Protocol** — the machine entered a failsafe mode
3. **Soulstream Imbalance** — corruption / overload
4. **Tampering by Lux Arcanium** — an arcane experiment gone wrong
5. **The Broken’s Awakening** — something beneath the peninsula caused it

Your choice determines antagonist motivations.

## Five Years Ago — The Shattered Statues

This was **a side effect** of a malfunctioning soulstream valve in the planetary engine.

Statues broke because:
- They are vessels lacking souls
- The soulstream pulse disrupted soul‑adjacent constructs
- Figurative sculptures resonated directly with the pulse’s emotional frequency

Clues to this truth can appear throughout the world:
- Damaged soul wells
- Monuments that hum with power
- Machine components beneath old ruins

This serves as a breadcrumb toward understanding soulstream harmonics.

## Regional Agendas (GM Version)

### Radiant Seat

**Public face:** Holy arbiters of light  
**Secretly:**
- Seek to monopolize soul‑energy research
- May want the world to remain fixed in eternal light zones
- Have agents observing Lux Arcanium
- May hide early knowledge of the Terminus

---
### Samitra
**Public:** Stoic desert kingdom  
**Private:**
- Facing resource collapse
- Has ancient ruins connected to the planetary engine
- Might launch military action if answers don’t come soon

---
### Voland Etherium
**Public:** Isolated sky empire  
**Secret:**
- Benefited from the Terminus (air currents stabilized)
- Emperor wants to keep perpetual darkness in rivals
- May have fragments of ancient schematics
- Has a secret order devoted to protecting the status quo

---
### Dhruv

**Public:** Forest nation struggling in darkness  
**Secret:**
- Radical factions want war with Lux Arcanium
- Some elders know the darkness was **not** caused by magic
- Forest spirits whisper of the Broken’s resurgence
- May shelter an ancient planetary engine access point

---
### Savawell Thicket

**Public:** A dangerous frontier forest filled with beasts and strange weather.
**Secret:**
- A **fractured soulstream node** lies beneath Savawell
- The Thicket mutates due to **engine leakage**
- Terrain shifts due to unstable energy flows
- It serves as a **warning zone** before entering the Broken
- Ruins of a **pre‑Terminus culture** hide within the inner groves
- Some creatures inside are malformed by failed stabilizer pulses
- The forest “breathes”—trees subtly rearrange over days or weeks
- A place for visions or hallucinations
- Stepping stone into true engine-access areas
- A location where Soulstream anomalies can be physically shown
- A region where the PCs can learn the cost of tampering with ancient systems
- Perfect site for early‑campaign “dangerous exploration”

---
### Galatea

**Public:** Peaceful horse plains  
**Secret:**
- Crucial food supplier—ripe for invasion
- Has a prophetic tradition tied to the stars
- Only region to record the exact moment of the Terminus

---
### The Broken

**Public:** Uncharted  
**Secret:**
- Contains a **collapsed access node** to the planetary engine
- Ruins shift due to engine energy leakage
- May house a pre‑Terminus civilization remnant
- The sea spirits/“water tribe” disappearance ties to this place

This is the _late‑campaign reveal zone_.

---
### Lux Arcanium

**Public:** Neutral arcane university  
**Secret:**
- Houses a sub‑basement containing a planetary engine conduit
- Has _accidentally_ triggered soulstream fluctuations in the past
- Some faculty want to restart the world
- Some want to seize control of the engine
- Some want to keep it offline to prevent a worse disaster

Excellent source of plot twists and moral dilemmas.

- Wants revenge
- Uses nature‑twisted magic
### 3. “The Custodians” — Planetary Engine Wardens
- Believe mortals must _not_ restart the engine
- Could be ancient machines, spirits, or descendants of the Builders
### 4. Lux Arcanium Internal Faction
- Tried to activate something they shouldn’t
- Wants the party to succeed… or fail… depending on what you choose
### 5. The Ancient Ones / Remnants in The Broken

## GM Tools: Session Structure

### Early Campaign
- Local conflicts (Radiant Seat politics, Dhruv accusations)
- Lux Arcanium investigations
- First trips into dark zones and light zones
- Savawell Thicket as first major anomaly site
### Mid Campaign
- Discovery of engine components
- Airship diplomacy (& sabotage)
- Reveal of antagonist motives
- Samitra ruins
- Voland Etherium involvement
- First expedition toward The Broken
### Late Campaign
- Descent into the planetary engine
- Reveal of who built it
- Faction war or unity moment
- The choice:
    - Restart rotation
    - Modify it
    - Leave it as-is
    - Replace the system entirely
The endgame should reflect the party’s themes.

## Additional Seeds for You (GM Only)

### Prophecy Hook
A prophecy reads:

> _“When the statues break, the world’s heart wakes.”_  
> Only Galatea knows the full text.

### Lux Arcanium Secret Archive
The academy stored the last known map showing the world _before_ the Terminus.

### Voland Etherium’s Sky Code
The air currents reveal patterns only visible from high altitude—clues to the engine’s structure.

### Dhruv’s Forest Whispers
Trees petrified moments before the Terminus hold trapped soul voices.
